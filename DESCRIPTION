Title: Methods for Adaptive Shrinkage, using Empirical Bayes
Description: The main function in the ashr package is \code{\link{ash}}, which should be examined for more details. For simplicity only the most commonly used options are documented under \code{\link{ash}}. For expert or interested users the documentation for function \code{\link{ash.workhorse}} provides documentation on all implemented options. These functions are based on the methods proposed in M. Stephens, 2016, "False discovery rates: a new deal", <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>.
