Notes for final CRAN submission:
* Tested with latest release of R; R CMD CHECK returns 0 errors, 0
  warnings and 0 notes.
* Should I be the maintainer, or Matthew?
* Should we merge Muzhe's changes first?

to do:
* Reduce running time for ashr/tests to <5 seconds.
* Run win-builder on ashr package.
